The project explores the design and development of an open-ended, modular hardware/software interface named "Octopus" to expand research in multi-modal data exploration. The system is designed for integration with the "Dark Sonification" framework developed by PhD researcher Miguel Angel Crozzoli, an interactive data display system for exploratory data analysis through affect, and focuses on applying data physicalization techniques through haptic feedback. "Octopus" is an open-source, customizable device that provides an embodied interface for data navigation and interaction. By bridging the gap between flexible software and reconfigurable hardware, the project contributes to the emerging field of Data-Human Interaction and addresses the societal need for accessible and inclusive scientific tools. The interfaceâ€™s design emphasizes versatility, enabling researchers to rapidly prototype new ideas and integrate novel sensory modalities for enhanced data understanding.
