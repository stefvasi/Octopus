# Octopus: Modular Interface for Multi-Modal Data Exploration

The project explores the design and development of an open-ended, modular hardware/software interface named **"Octopus"** to expand research in multi-modal data exploration.

The system is designed for integration with the **"Dark Sonification"** framework developed by PhD researcher Miguel Angel Crozzoli, an interactive data display system for exploratory data analysis through affect, and focuses on applying data **physicalization** techniques through **haptic feedback**.
